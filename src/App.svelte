	<h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>

	<p>I'm Fabian, I make software and games and stuffs.</p>

	<h2>👨‍💻 What I usually work on</h2>

	<h3>🟦🟧🟥 trivago</h3>

	After my internship, I was lucky to be offered a position as a backend
	engineer at trivago. There, I now work on a network of microservices for
	aggregating and delivering data. Everything is built with Kotlin, a language I
	had to learn from scratch when I started there. Quite the experience with my
	limited toolset of student knowledge. But also quite the beautiful language 😍

	<h3>Game Development</h3>

	Currently completely paused. I made games for the past 2+ years and burned out
	pretty hard on them. Working in the confines of a game engine / framework is
	not always the most rewarding development cycle. And building your own engine?
	Ain't nobody got time for that!

	<h3>Alternate Universe</h3>

	Alternate Universe is a FiveM freeroam server. I built most of the tools and
	plugins there. I since decided to step down as the main dev due to the ever
	increasing work load in a very limited time capacity. I still support the
	operations of the project and work on some experimental features, but now with
	a more recreational-oriented time management.

	<h3>Web</h3>
	<p>
		I learned Angular in uni, but it was too bloaty for me to make some simple
		projects. I then focused on React, but really understanding TSX is not easy.
		Recently I got introduced to Svelte, but that's still a lot of Voodoo magic
		to me. Let's see where that journey goes...
	</p>
	<p>That is also the reason this website looks so shit.</p>

	<h3>Misc</h3>

	I tried to learn some Rust, but the syntax was kinda weird. Still gonna try it
	at a later date tho, just not in the mood right now.

	<h2>💬 Ask me about</h2>

	<h3>Unity game engine</h3>

	I've worked with Unity during my studies on hobby, university and even a
	commercial project. I got quite a glimpse of this beast and can get you
	started learning how to make games. I'm no professional though 😅
